# JARVIS

#### Voice command based home automation for your Raspberry Pi.

## Introduction
For our school project, we decided to create a voice command based home automation device called **JARVIS**, inspired by the talking computer with the same name in Ironman.

We actually grabbed a **Raspberry Pi**, plugged in some stuff and wrote some **Jasper** modules in **Python**.

## Features
- Get current average fuel prices in Germany
- Play internet radio
- Run a live ticker for your favorite soccer team

- USB WLAN adapter or ethernet cable
- 433 MHz wireless socket
- 433 MHz wireless send and receiver module

## Notice
As this repository is part of a **school project**, the active development is only happening during that school project period. If you want to maintain this project feel free to contact us.
